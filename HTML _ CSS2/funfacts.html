<td><img src="a.jpg" width="420px" height="420px"><p>AQUATIC TURTLE:<br>The shell of a turtle is made up of 60 different bones all connected together.
A turtle’s mouth, usually called the beak, contains no teeth (but be careful, their bites can still hurt)!
Aquatic turtles have to be in water to eat.</td>

<td><img src="b.jpg" width="420px" height="420px"><p>BALL PYTHON:<br>In the United States, the ball python received its name because it curls itself into a ball with its head in the center when it becomes nervous or upset.
The ball python can swim well when necessary.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="c.jpg" width="420px" height="420px"><p>BEARDED DRAGON:<br>Male Bearded Dragons bob their head quickly to show other dragons that they’re dominant.
The bearded dragon uses its beard  to make it look larger to potential attackers.
In the wild, Bearded Dragons will often stand up on their hind legs to run from danger.
Bearded dragons can excrete ‘dry’ urine to conserve fluids in their native desert habitat.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="d.jpg" width="420px" height="420px"><p>BETTA FISH:<br>There are more than 25 colors of Betta Fish, including red, blue, green, yellow, orange, pastel, purple, transparent, black, white and many more.
A male betta often flares its fins when it feels threatened.
For male betta fish, richer the color, the healthier they are.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="e.jpg" width="420px" height="420px"><p>CHINCHILLA:<br>Chinchillas can jump up to five feet in the air.
The chinchilla has the softest fur in the world, about thirty times softer than human hair.
Chinchillas often release a part of their fur when they feel scared in order to mislead predators when they are under attack (the fur does grow back).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="f.jpg" width="420px" height="420px"><p>GERBIL:<br>Gerbils recognize each other by the taste of their saliva. That is why it looks like they are rubbing noses when they meet, they are actually licking each other’s mouths!
Does your gerbil ever push at your hand with its head? This means that it is irritated and wants to be left alone.
When a gerbil is excited, it will sometimes jump with all four feet in the air.</td>
